# gatsby-plugin-pdf-thumbnail

Automatically generate thumbnail images of all PDF assets hosted in your Contentful space.

This is a partial implementation that worked for my personal use case (self-hosted PDFs using `localFile`),
but is not a complete/tested solution. The PDF renderer used under the covers
is not perfect and does not always generate perfect thumbnail images, and also generates quite a few warnings
for PDFs generated by proprietary tools with custom fonts.

## Use

Add `gatsby-plugin-pdf-thumbnail` to `gatsby-config.js` plugins list

Contentful PDFs should be automatically detected and post-processed by this plugin. Thumbnails will be added to the
GraphQL schema under each PDF's `localFile` node
